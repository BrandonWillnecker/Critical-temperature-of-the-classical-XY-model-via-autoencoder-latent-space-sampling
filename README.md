# Critical-temperature-of-the-classical-XY-model-via-autoencoder-latent-space-sampling
A repository of some appendix code for the associated research paper 

I have included the MCMC code used to generate the training data. Some optimizations have been explained in the code. The Neural Network architecture (layers, activations, etc) are stated. The Neural Network code can be found in the NeuralNetwork.h file in the PhD section with the other projects. The statistical analysis of the latent space distributions are done in Python using Numpy for numpy.average and numpy.std

Extra images of vortices and antivortices are also provided

Updates will be made available when possible
